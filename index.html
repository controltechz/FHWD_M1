		<p style="font-size:30px"> <small>Lorem Ipsum</small> is simply dummy text of the printing and <mark>typesetting industry</mark>. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <i>1500s</i>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only <sub>five</sub> centuries, but also the leap into <sup>electronic</sup> typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <u>1960s</u> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <a href="#">software</a>like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>. <del>This text has been deleted.</del></p>

		<blockquote>"It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution."</blockquote>
